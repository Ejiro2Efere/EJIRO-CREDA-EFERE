# [PROJECT 2: Fasting Blood Suger Level and Pregnancy] (https://github.com/Ejiro2Efere/MyFirstworks/blob/main/notebook4b27787393.ipynb)
### Backgroung information
- A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.
- For pregnant women, we suggest the following target for women testing blood glucose levels during pregnancy: Before a meal: 95 mg/dl or less. One hour after a meal: 140 mg/dl or less. Two hours after a meal: 120 mg/dl or less.
- You are asked to check the correlation of fasting blood sugar and how it affects pregnancy.
